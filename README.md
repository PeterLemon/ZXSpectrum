ZXSpectrum
==========
<br />
ZX Spectrum Bare Metal Code by krom (Peter Lemon).<br />
<br />
All code compiles out of box with the bass assembler by byuu.<br />
I use a special version of bass by ARM9 which has been updated with ZX Spectrum Z80 output:<br />
https://github.com/ARM9/bass<br />
I have included binaries of all the demos.<br />
<br />
I also use a tool called Image Spectrumizer, which I use to convert GFX to the ZX Spectrum screen:<br />

Special thanks to Dobo/spec-chum, who has helped me get into ZX Spectrum Coding =D<br />

Please check out Speccy by Marat Fayzullin, an accurate ZX Spectrum emulator with debugger:<br />

<br />
Howto Compile:<br />
All the code compiles into a single binary (TAPENAME.Z80) file.<br />
Using bass Run: make.bat<br />
<br />
Howto Run:<br />
I only test with a real ZX Spectrum 128+3 using the fast disk upload tool Project OTLA:<br />
